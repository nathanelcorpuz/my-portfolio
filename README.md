### Thank you for reading up to this point! Here's a favorite quote of mine from Seneca as a token of my appreciation:

_"I don't complain about the lack of time... what little I have will go far enough. Today--this day--will achieve what no tomorrow will fail to speak about. I will lay siege to the gods and shake up the world"_

--Seneca, Medea, 423-425
